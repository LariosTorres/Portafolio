# Portafolio personal

Hi, this is a quick little introduction to my professional portfolio!

I'm Jose de Jesus Larios Torres, Jr. web developer with a long way to go.

In this portfolio I will be showing all the projects that I have developed and that I will continue to develop, this will be one of my longest projects because I will be showing all my progress on the long path that I have decided to take in order to one day be able to call it a developer.
